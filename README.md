## Forward Kinematics

The following figure is the forward kinematics

## Inverse Kinematics

The index of function *InverseKinematics(O_LeftLeg, K_LeftLeg)* can decide which arm (or leg) to approach the target.

The following table is the result of inverse kinematics for the right arm.

The origin positions are [ 7.75  0  -10  1 ], and the targets are [ 5  3  -4  1 ].
